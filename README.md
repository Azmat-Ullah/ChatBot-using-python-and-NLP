Task Description: Chatbot for SkillSync Interns
Objective:
Build a basic chatbot using Python and natural language processing (NLP) techniques
Requirements:
 Define the Scope and Purpose.
 A Python Framework.
 Data Collection and Preprocessing.

Technical Guidelines:
1. Environment Setup:
Make sure you have Python installed, and install the necessary libraries.
2. Import Libraries:
// import nltk
// from nltk.chat.util import Chat, reflections
3. Define Chatbot Rules:
//responses = {
"hello": ["Hey! I am chat bot of SkillSync Interns."],
"How are you": ["I'm good, thanks!", "I'm just a computer program, so I don't have
feelings, but I'm here to help!"],
"bye": ["Goodbye!", "See you later!", "Have a great day!"],
"default": ["I'm not sure what you mean.", "Could you please rephrase that?", "I don't
understand."],
}
//these are the basic responses that are given to you to make basic idea about the
functioning of the chat bot, you may also add more responses as per your need.
4. Use a dictionary called ‘responses’ to map user input to predefine responses.
5. Make a function that can check if the user input matches any of the predefined keys in the dictionary. If it does not, it selects a random response from the corresponding list. If not, it provides a default response.
6. If you are making chat bot using these responses simply execute your script in a Python environment, and you can start chatting with it.
7. Ensure your code follows best practices, including proper indentation, commenting, and meaningful variable names.
8. Include error handling to handle invalid inputs or other exceptional cases.
